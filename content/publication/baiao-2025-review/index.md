abstract: "The integration of multi-omics data is essential for understanding complex biological systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of multi-omics data integration methods, ranging from classical statistical approaches to state-of-the-art deep generative models. We discuss the challenges associated with high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and missing data, and highlight the potential of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and other deep learning techniques for data imputation, augmentation, and joint embedding. The review also covers emerging trends such as foundation models and contrastive learning in the context of multi-omics integration."
