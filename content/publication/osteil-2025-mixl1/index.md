abstract: "MIXL1 plays a critical role in endoderm differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that MIXL1 activation is a key determinant of the efficiency of definitive endoderm generation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). By modulating MIXL1 expression, we show that lineage propensity can be re-wired, enhancing the differentiation potential toward endoderm lineages. This work provides insights for optimizing stem cell differentiation protocols for regenerative medicine applications."
