abstract: "We introduce MOSA (Multi-Omic Synthetic Augmentation), an unsupervised deep learning model for integrating and augmenting cancer multi-omics data. By leveraging variational autoencoders, MOSA generates synthetic multi-omic profiles that expand the effective sample size of cancer datasets, enabling the discovery of new biomarkers and drug targets. We demonstrate that MOSA-augmented data improves the power of association studies and clustering analyses, providing a valuable resource for the cancer research community."
