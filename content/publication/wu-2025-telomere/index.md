abstract: "Telomere maintenance is a hallmark of cancer. Here, we present a large-scale analysis of telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) in 976 cancer cell lines. Integrating proteomic, genomic, and transcriptomic data with drug sensitivity and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens, we identify molecular features associated with telomerase activity and Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). We discover broad heterogeneity in telomere biology beyond the binary TMM classification and develop multi-omic predictors for TMM status. Our findings reveal potential therapeutic vulnerabilities linked to specific TMMs, providing a resource for developing telomere-targeted cancer therapies."
