The spread of misinformation can undermine confidence in vaccination. The capacity for social media to quickly and effectively spread information or misinformation is a pressing question for governments and global agencies. Tools such as deep learning, machine learning, sentiment analysis and text mining could provide solutions to help monitor the emergence of vaccine misinformation that underpin mitigation strategies and limit damage to vaccine confidence. You are invited to assist Assoc. Prof. Adam Dunn from the Faculty of Medicine and Health in designing a classifier to find vaccine sentiment in Twitter posts.
