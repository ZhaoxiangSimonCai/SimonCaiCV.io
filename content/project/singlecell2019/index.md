I designed a new method which can be used by embryologists to determine the embryo differentiation propensity, given bulk RNA-seq data or qPCR data. The method is novel in using combined different single-cell datasets as a reference, then mapping the bulk RNA data to the lineage tree that is inferred from the single-cell data. This new method will greatly facilitate experiments where only bulk sequencing can be used.
