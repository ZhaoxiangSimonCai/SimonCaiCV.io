I am a dynamic researcher and engineer with a robust background in both academic and industrial settings. My journey includes developing large-scale systems at Goldman Sachs, where I successfully managed complex projects under tight deadlines. My PhD in Cancer Data Science at the Children's Medical Research Institute, affiliated with the University of Sydney, marked a significant turn in my career towards integrating machine learning with oncological studies. My passion lies in harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionise healthcare, particularly in understanding and treating cancer. I am committed to pioneering advancements that will transform oncology, speeding the development of innovative therapies and improving patient outcomes. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid enthusiast of the piano, skiing, and badminton.
