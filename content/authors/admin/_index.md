I am an innovative researcher and engineer with experience in both academia and industry. I have worked on extremely large-scale systems while working for Goldman Sachs and world-leading international research projects during PhD. I am always passionate about taking cutting-edge research outcome into usable products, especially in healthcare industry. My current research interest is in cancer, and I believe the marriage of artificial intelligence and molecular biology will shift the paradigm of cancer research, expedite the development of new therapies, and allow patients to live longer and better. I enjoy playing the piano, skiing and badminton in spare time.
